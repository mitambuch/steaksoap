# AI Command Reference

Complete list of Claude Code slash commands in this project.

## Scaffolding

| Command | Arguments | What it creates |
|---|---|---|
| `/new-page` | `PageName` | Page + route constant + lazy import + test |
| `/new-component` | `ComponentName [ui\|feature\|layout]` | Component + test in the right folder |

Claude Code creates:
  src/features/user-profile/
  ├── UserProfile.tsx         — main component
  ├── UserProfile.types.ts    — TypeScript interfaces
  ├── useUserProfile.ts       — custom hook
  ├── index.ts                — barrel export
  └── __tests__/
      └── UserProfile.test.tsx — component test
```

### Example: Creating a page

```
You: /new-page About

Claude Code creates:
  src/pages/About.tsx           — page component with SeoHead
  src/pages/__tests__/About.test.tsx  — render + a11y test
  src/constants/routes.ts       — ABOUT: '/about' added
  src/app/routes/index.tsx      — lazy import + Route added
```

## Workflow

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/spec` | `"description"` | Generate a structured spec before coding |
| `/status` | — | Git status, validation report, dependency health |
| `/deploy` | — | Validate, build, deploy to Vercel or Netlify |
| `/release` | — | Analyze commits, version bump, changelog, git tag |
| `/update-deps` | — | Safe dependency updates with validation after each |
| `/fix` | `"description of bug"` | Systematic bug diagnosis and fix |
| `/migrate` | `path or description` | Analyze existing project → structured migration plan |
| `/handoff` | — | Generate HANDOFF.md — full project doc for human devs (no AI needed) |
| `/health-check` | — | Monthly project audit: deps, tests, docs drift, code quality |

### Example: Speccing a feature

```
You: /spec "a contact form that sends emails"

Claude Code:
  1. Reads decisions.md + registry/extensions.json
  2. Generates structured spec:
     - What: contact form with name, email, message fields
     - Components: ContactForm (new), Input/Textarea/Button (existing)
     - Extensions needed: Resend (resend-email from registry)
     - Manual steps: create Resend account, add API key
  3. Saves spec to docs/specs/contact-form.md
  4. Asks: "Want me to proceed with this plan?"
```

### Example: Checking status

```
You: /status

Claude Code:
  Branch: main (clean)
  Last release: v1.4.0 (3 commits since)
  Validation: ✓ all checks pass
  Outdated: 2 packages (minor updates available)
  Suggestion: "Ready for a patch release when you want."
```

### Example: Fixing a bug

```
You: /fix "Modal doesn't close when clicking outside"

Claude Code:
  1. Reproduces → opens the Modal, clicks backdrop
  2. Searches → finds Modal.tsx, reads click handler
  3. Isolates → backdrop onClick missing stopPropagation
  4. Fixes → adds event handler
  5. Proves → writes test that fails without fix
  6. Validates → pnpm validate passes
  7. Commits → fix(modal): close on backdrop click
```

### Example: Migrating an existing project

```
You: /migrate "../my-portfolio"

Claude Code:
  1. Scans → reads package.json, file structure, styles
  2. Compares → maps components to project equivalents
  3. Generates migration plan:
     - 4 pages to recreate via /new-page
     - 6 components to port to TypeScript + tokens
     - Design tokens to extract (accent, bg, fonts)
     - Estimated: 2 hours with AI assistance
  4. Asks: "Want me to start with step 1?"
  5. Executes step by step → validate → commit after each group
```

### Example: Generating a handoff document

```
You: /handoff

Claude Code:
  1. Scans project: package.json, routes, components, features
  2. Reads design tokens, config, decisions
  3. Generates HANDOFF.md at project root:
     - Quick start (3 steps)
     - Full tech stack with versions
     - Architecture overview
     - All routes and pages
     - Design system (colors, fonts, components)
     - How-to guides (add page, change theme, deploy)
     - Git workflow and CI/CD
     - Technical decisions with reasoning
  4. Zero references to AI tools — readable by any developer
```

### Example: Running a health check

```
You: /health-check

Claude Code:
  VALIDATION           ✅ Pass
  DEPENDENCIES         ⚠️ 3 outdated (1 critical)
  CODE QUALITY         ✅ Clean
  TEST COVERAGE        ✅ 82%
  DOCUMENTATION        ⚠️ 1 file drifted
  INFRASTRUCTURE       ✅ Complete

  SCORE: 8.5/10

  🔴 Critical: update vite (security patch)
  🟡 Important: HANDOFF.md is 2 months old — regenerate
  🟢 Nice to have: add test for new ContactForm feature
```

## Discovery

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/discover` | `"description"` | Find extensions and MCP servers by natural language |
| `/install-extension` | `extension-id` | Install a specific extension by ID (e.g., "zustand") |
| `/connect` | `server name` | Install a MCP server from the registry (e.g., "github", "playwright") |
| `/refactor` | `file or feature` | Analyze code against rules, classify and fix issues |

### Example: Discovering tools

```
You: /discover "browser testing"

Claude Code:
  1. Reads registry/extensions.json + registry/mcp-servers.json
  2. Shows two categories:
     📦 Extensions: Playwright E2E (install in your project)
     🔌 MCP Servers: Playwright Browser (connect to Claude Code)
  3. Asks: "Want me to install or connect one of these?"
```

### Example: Connecting a MCP server

```
You: /connect github

Claude Code:
  1. Looks up "github" in registry/mcp-servers.json
  2. Shows: GitHub MCP — manage repos, PRs, issues
  3. Asks: "This requires GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN. Ready?"
  4. Runs: claude mcp add --transport stdio github -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
  5. Verifies: claude mcp list → github ✓
```

### Example: Refactoring code

```
You: /refactor src/features/auth

Claude Code:
  1. Reads rules: components.md, api.md, testing.md
  2. Reads decisions.md for architectural context
  3. Analyzes all files in src/features/auth/
  4. Classifies:
     MUST FIX: missing AbortController in fetch hook
     SHOULD FIX: inline styles instead of tokens
     NICE TO HAVE: extract shared types to .types.ts
  5. Asks: "Apply all? Or pick which ones?"
  6. Applies → validates → commits
```

See [recipes/add-extension.md](recipes/add-extension.md) for the full list of available extensions.

## Quality

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/review` | — | Code review of recent changes |
| `/lighthouse` | `[page path]` | Full quality audit: performance, bundle, a11y, SEO, responsive |
| `/test` | `[file or feature]` | Run tests + find coverage gaps |
| `/theme` | `"description of changes"` | Modify design tokens interactively |
| `/responsive-check` | `[page or component]` | Verify all breakpoints (320px to 1440px) |

### Example: Theme customization

```
You: /theme "warm orange accents, softer backgrounds"

Claude Code:
  1. Reads current tokens in src/index.css
  2. Proposes: accent #f97316, bg #0f0f0f, surface #1a1a1a
  3. Shows contrast ratios for each combination
  4. Applies changes to both dark and light themes
  5. Validates → pnpm validate passes
```

### Example: Running a lighthouse audit

```
You: /lighthouse

Claude Code:
  Performance:    9/10   (bundle 272kb, no chunk > 200kb)
  Accessibility:  10/10  (all checks pass)
  SEO:            9/10   (missing OG image)
  Responsive:     10/10  (320px to 1440px verified)
  Best Practices: 10/10

  🔴 MUST FIX: none
  🟡 SHOULD FIX: add OG image meta tag
  🟢 NICE TO HAVE: consider code splitting for Playground
```

## Sub-agents

Agents are specialized personas that Claude Code can adopt.
See [agents.md](agents.md) for full documentation.

| Agent | When to use |
|---|---|
| `reviewer` | "Act as the reviewer agent and check my code" |
| `debugger` | "Act as the debugger agent to fix this issue" |
| `designer` | "Act as the designer agent for this UI change" |
| `tester` | "Act as the tester agent to write tests for this" |

### Example: Using an agent

```
You: "Act as the designer agent and improve the About page"

Claude Code (as designer):
  1. Reads src/index.css tokens + DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
  2. Reads src/pages/About.tsx
  3. Proposes: larger hero, mono micro labels, capsule CTAs
  4. Applies changes following the classe2 style DNA
  5. Validates → commits
```
