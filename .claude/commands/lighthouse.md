## Steps

1. `pnpm build` — ensure production build works

2. Check each category:

### Performance
- [ ] Bundle: total dist/ size reported
- [ ] No single chunk > 200KB
- [ ] Largest files identified
- [ ] Images: loading="lazy" below fold
- [ ] Routes: all lazy loaded
- [ ] Deps: none > 50kb unjustified
- [ ] No inline objects/arrays in JSX
- [ ] Animations: transform/opacity only
- [ ] Mobile: reduced animation complexity

### Accessibility

- [ ] Contrast: WCAG AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large)
- [ ] Focus visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Skip-to-content link
- [ ] No tabindex > 0

### SEO
- [ ] Every page: SeoHead with unique title + description
- [ ] Sitemap generated
- [ ] robots.txt in public/
- [ ] Open Graph meta tags
- [ ] Canonical URLs

### Responsive
